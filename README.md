# NotesCommon
Common libraries used in developing classic Lotus Notes applications (LotusScript, Formula, etc.).

This is a on-disk Notes database that contains serveral LotusScript libraries, agents, forms, views, etc. developed over serveral years of my work.

The main code for this project is in the Code/ScriptLibraries folder.
